# Document Generation Functionality - Testing and Deployment Guide

## Testing Guide

### Unit Testing

#### Components
Test each component individually to ensure they render correctly and handle user interactions as expected:

1. **TemplateList**
   - Test rendering with and without templates
   - Test category filtering functionality
   - Test search functionality
   - Test loading and error states

2. **DocumentEditor**
   - Test form rendering with different field types
   - Test form validation (required fields, etc.)
   - Test form submission
   - Test preview toggle

3. **DocumentPreview**
   - Test content rendering with different template types
   - Test export functionality
   - Test print functionality

#### Store
Test the Zustand store to ensure state management works correctly:

1. **Template Actions**
   - Test fetching templates
   - Test selecting a template

2. **Document Actions**
   - Test creating a document
   - Test updating a document
   - Test deleting a document

3. **Form Actions**
   - Test form value updates
   - Test validation
   - Test history (undo/redo)

### Integration Testing

1. **Template Selection Flow**
   - Test navigating from templates list to editor
   - Test template data loading in editor

2. **Document Creation Flow**
   - Test filling out a form and saving a document
   - Test validation during the process

3. **Document Management Flow**
   - Test viewing the list of documents
   - Test editing an existing document
   - Test deleting a document

### API Testing

1. **Templates API**
   - Test GET /api/web/templates
   - Test GET /api/web/templates/[id]
   - Test error handling (not found, unauthorized)

2. **Documents API**
   - Test GET /api/web/documents
   - Test GET /api/web/documents/[id]
   - Test POST /api/web/documents
   - Test PUT /api/web/documents/[id]
   - Test DELETE /api/web/documents/[id]
   - Test error handling

3. **Export API**
   - Test POST /api/web/documents/export
   - Test different export formats
   - Test error handling

### End-to-End Testing

Create E2E tests that simulate real user flows:

1. **Complete Document Creation Flow**
   - Navigate to templates
   - Select a template
   - Fill out the form
   - Save the document
   - Verify it appears in the documents list

2. **Document Editing Flow**
   - Navigate to documents
   - Select a document to edit
   - Modify some fields
   - Save changes
   - Verify changes are reflected

3. **Document Export Flow**
   - Navigate to a document
   - Export in different formats
   - Verify the exported files

### Cross-Browser Testing

Test the functionality in different browsers to ensure compatibility:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

### Responsive Testing

Test the UI on different device sizes:
- Desktop
- Tablet
- Mobile

## Deployment Guide

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Code Review**
   - Ensure all code follows project standards
   - Check for any security vulnerabilities
   - Verify error handling is comprehensive

2. **Performance Check**
   - Run Lighthouse audits
   - Check for any performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize large components if needed

3. **Accessibility Check**
   - Ensure all forms are accessible
   - Check keyboard navigation
   - Verify screen reader compatibility

4. **Final Testing**
   - Run all tests one final time
   - Perform manual testing of critical paths

### Deployment Steps

1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy to staging environment first
   - Run smoke tests to verify basic functionality
   - Get stakeholder approval

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Use CI/CD pipeline for deployment
   - Deploy during low-traffic hours if possible
   - Monitor logs during deployment

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**
   - Verify all routes are accessible
   - Check API endpoints are responding correctly
   - Test document creation and export in production

### Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. **Identify Issue Severity**
   - Determine if immediate rollback is needed
   - Check if a hotfix is possible

2. **Rollback Process**
   - Revert to the previous stable version
   - Notify users of temporary service disruption
   - Verify system is back to normal operation

3. **Issue Resolution**
   - Fix the issue in development
   - Follow the deployment process again

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Monitoring

1. **Error Tracking**
   - Monitor client-side errors
   - Track API failures
   - Set up alerts for critical errors

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track page load times
   - Monitor API response times
   - Watch for memory leaks

3. **Usage Analytics**
   - Track which templates are most popular
   - Monitor document creation rates
   - Identify potential UX improvements

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Plan for regular dependency updates
   - Schedule periodic code refactoring
   - Update mock data with real templates as they become available

2. **Feature Expansion**
   - Implement the future improvements identified in the summary
   - Gather user feedback for new features
   - Prioritize enhancements based on user needs

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep documentation up to date
   - Document any API changes
   - Update user guides as needed

## Conclusion

This testing and deployment guide provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the document generation functionality is thoroughly tested and safely deployed. Following these guidelines will help maintain a high-quality user experience and minimize the risk of issues in production.
