## How to Fix "OAuth client was not found" Error

The error "OAuth client was not found" occurs when the Google OAuth credentials are invalid or not properly configured. To fix this issue:

1. **Verify Google OAuth Credentials**
   - Ensure that the credentials in `.env.local` are correct and match those in the Google Cloud Console
   - Check that the credentials are for the correct project and have not expired

2. **Check Google Cloud Console Configuration**
   - Verify that the authorized JavaScript origins include `http://localhost:3000` (for development)
   - Verify that the authorized redirect URIs include `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google` (for development)
   - Ensure that the OAuth consent screen is properly configured

3. **Enable Required APIs**
   - Make sure the Google OAuth API is enabled in the Google Cloud Console

4. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Ensure that `.env.local` contains the correct credentials:
     ```
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-actual-client-id
     GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-actual-client-secret
     ```

5. **Restart the Application**
   - After making changes to the environment variables, restart the application:
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```

## Testing the Fix

To verify that the issue is fixed:

1. Navigate to the login page
2. Click the "Google" button to sign in with Google
3. You should be redirected to Google's authentication page
4. After authenticating, you should be redirected back to the application

If you still encounter issues, check the browser console for error messages and refer to the error page for guidance.
